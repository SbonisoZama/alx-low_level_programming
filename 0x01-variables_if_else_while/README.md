# Variables, If, Else, While - C Programming Basics

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of C programming, including variable declarations, conditional statements (`if`, `else`), and looping structures (`while`). It includes examples of how to use these constructs to solve basic programming problems and perform simple operations.

## Features
- Demonstrates the use of variables for storing data.
- Shows how to use `if` and `else` statements for decision-making.
- Illustrates the use of `while` loops for repetition and iteration.
- Includes random number generation to showcase conditionals in action.
